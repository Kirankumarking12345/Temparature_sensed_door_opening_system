# Temparature_sensed_door_opening_system

Now a days carona pandemic is very horrible. We can not who had got effected.... So this project is all about detecting the carona positive people and separate
them from spreading the Carona.

The project is very usefull to reduce the spreading of carona cases in mass gathering places..

This setup is placed near the entry gate of the mass gathering places

The project detects the temparature of the person at the gate and check that if he had the fever or not and display temparature of candidate. If he had fever then 
buzzer rings and door not opened or else the door will be open and allow the person to come into the gate after crossing the gate there will be a ir based hand 
sanitzer..

In this way we can prevent the spreading of cases in this
